Script for Automating Google Account Creation Using Puppeteer
This is a script written in JavaScript using the Puppeteer library to automate the creation of a Google account. The script launches a headless Chromium browser and navigates to the Google account creation page.

It then fills in the required fields, such as name, username, and password, and clicks the next button. The script also automates the verification of the phone number by waiting for the verification code to be entered and then filling in the code and clicking the verify button. Finally, the script waits for the terms of service and privacy policy to appear and clicks the accept button. Once the account is successfully created, the script closes the browser.

The script requires the 'dotenv' library to load environment variables and a custom 'getPhoneNumberAndSMS' function to get a phone number and SMS verification code. The username is hardcoded to '41rdg6br', and the password is loaded from an environment variable. The headless mode is disabled to show the automation process. The 'disable-web-security' and 'no-sandbox' flags are passed as arguments to launch the browser. These flags are used to bypass certain security features of the browser and should be used with caution.

Overall, this script demonstrates how to automate a complex task such as creating a Google account using Puppeteer.


This is a Node.js script that uses the Puppeteer library to automate the creation of a Google account. The script launches a new instance of the Chromium browser in headless mode and navigates to the Google account signup page. It then fills out the form fields for name, username, and password, and clicks the "Next" button.

Next, it fills out the phone number field with a hardcoded value (in this case, "11946540606") and clicks the confirmation button. It then waits for the phone number to be verified before filling out the remaining form fields for the birthdate and gender. Finally, it accepts the terms of service and privacy policy and closes the browser.

Note that some portions of the script have been commented out, indicating that they are either unfinished or unnecessary for the script's current purpose. The script also imports a custom function called getPhoneNumberAndSMS from another module, which is likely used to retrieve the phone number and SMS verification code from an external source.
